# StudentAccommodationMgmtSys

This is an Academic Project to create an online system based on Java EE Architecture that helps both Admins to manage, add, update data of available accomodations 
to the application and Students to find their suitable rooms based on the details posted by the Admin & 'Check In' or 'Check Out' of them with ease.
